The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if not used correctly. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected within nested elements due to the way percentages are calculated relative to the containing element's size.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with units that aren't compatible, leading to parsing errors. For example, `calc(10px + 10em)` would be valid, but `calc(10px + 10%)` would not be.  Incorrect spacing within the `calc()` expression can also cause errors.
